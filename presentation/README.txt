We present a new kind of geo data : Point Cloud Data.
We explain why it is better stored in a Point Cloud Server (using PostgreSA + PostGIS + PointCloud) compared to using a file system solution
We demonstrate that with this kind of server querying the data is very fast.
We use this ability to show in-base processing example,
and to use the Point Cloud server in complex architecture (points streaming, visualization with LOD, web service processing)
